# Sample PenCom Complaint and Enquiry Emails

## RSA Unit Emails

### Email 1: RSA Transfer Delay
**Subject:** Urgent: RSA Transfer Pending for 6 Months

Dear PenCom,

I am writing to complain about the delay in my RSA transfer from Stanbic IBTC Pension to ARM Pension. I initiated this transfer on May 15, 2024, and submitted all required documents including my signed transfer form, valid means of identification, and BVN.

Despite following up multiple times with my current PFA, they claim they are still awaiting provisional approval from PenCom. It has been over 6 months now and this delay is affecting my ability to access my retirement benefits.

My RSA PIN is PEN123456789012. Please urgently look into this matter and expedite the approval process.

Thank you.

Best regards,

### Email 2: Multiple RSA PINs Issue
**Subject:** Request to Merge Duplicate RSA Accounts

Good day,

I recently discovered that I have two RSA PINs assigned to my account. During my employment with my previous employer (XYZ Limited), I was assigned PIN: PEN100234567890. However, when I changed jobs to ABC Nigeria Ltd, my new employer registered me with a different PFA and I was issued a new PIN: PEN100987654321.

I was not aware that I already had an existing RSA and now I have contributions split across two accounts. Please advise on the process to merge these accounts and consolidate my pension contributions under one PIN.

My details are:
- Name: Aisha Mohammed
- BVN: 12345678901
- Phone: 0701-234-5678

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
Aisha Mohammed

### Email 3: RSA Balance Enquiry
**Subject:** Unable to Access RSA Balance Statement

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been trying to obtain my current RSA balance statement from my PFA (Premium Pension Limited) for the past three weeks without success. Each time I call their customer service, I am given different excuses ranging from "system is down" to "statements will be sent via email."

I need this statement urgently to verify my pension contributions and plan my retirement. My RSA PIN is PEN456789123456.

Can PenCom intervene and ensure that PFAs provide timely account statements to contributors as required by regulation?

Thank you.

### Email 5: Correction of Contributor Details

Dear PenCom,

I need to update my name on the National Databank records due to a recent marriage. My registered name is currently "Grace Nnamdi" but I now legally go by "Grace Okoro-Nnamdi" following my marriage certificate.

My PFA (NLPC Pension) has updated their records but informed me that the change must also be reflected in PenCom's National Databank for complete synchronization.

Please find attached:
1. Marriage certificate
2. Sworn affidavit
3. Valid means of identification
4. Copy of RSA certificate

My RSA PIN: PEN789456123789

Kindly process this update at your earliest convenience.

### Email 6: VNIN Related Issue

Good afternoon,

I have verified my VNIN with NIMC and it is active and valid. However, the integration with my pension records seems to have an issue.

My details:

- VNIN: 12AB34CD56EF
- Name: Emeka Nwankwo
- Phone: 0805-432-1098

Please assist in resolving this technical issue so I can complete my data recapture exercise.

## Compliance/Surveillance Department Emails

### Email 7: Non-Remittance of Pension Contributions
**Subject:** URGENT: Employer Failing to Remit Pension Contributions

Dear PenCom Compliance Team,

I am writing to formally report my employer, Delta Manufacturing Company Limited (Employer Code: EMP123456), for failure to remit pension contributions deducted from employees' salaries.

For the past 8 months (March 2024 - October 2024), the company has been deducting our 8% employee pension contributions but has neither remitted these funds nor the employer's 10% contribution to our respective PFAs.

When we confronted the management, they claimed they are facing cash flow challenges and promised to remit "soon," but nothing has happened. This is a clear violation of the Pension Reform Act and is jeopardizing our retirement benefits.

Affected employees:
1. Tunde Bakare (RSA: PEN567890123456)
2. Ngozi Obi (RSA: PEN678901234567)
3. 15 other employees willing to provide statements

Please investigate this matter urgently and take appropriate action against our employer.

Submitted by:
Tunde Bakare (on behalf of affected employees)
Phone: 0806-789-0123
Email: tunde.bakare@email.com

### Email 9: Complaint Against PFA
**Subject:** Complaint Against Sigma Pensions - Unprofessional Conduct and Service Delays

Dear PenCom,

I wish to lodge a formal complaint against Sigma Pensions Limited for unprofessional conduct and persistent delays in processing my retirement benefits.

I retired from public service in June 2024 and submitted all required documents for my retirement benefits processing including:
- Retirement letter
- Letter of no objection from employer
- Duly completed retirement forms
- Valid ID and passport photographs

Despite submitting complete documentation over 5 months ago, Sigma Pensions has failed to process my programmed withdrawal. Each time I visit their office or call, I receive vague responses and no concrete timeline for payment.

This delay is causing me serious financial hardship as I have no other source of income. The PFA's negligence and lack of customer care is unacceptable.

My RSA PIN: PEN135792468135
Name: Chief Adebisi Ogunleye
Phone: 0807-654-3210
Email: adebisi.ogunleye@email.com

Please investigate this PFA and compel them to fulfill their obligations to retirees.

Respectfully,
Chief Adebisi Ogunleye
